Getting Started

This document is for upgrading OpenPNE 3.0.5 + to OpenPNE 3.2.x (or beta)

Be aware that this document doesn't consider for other versions.

You should backup your database before your upgrading.

Plan
----

The upgrading plan is the following:

(1) Setting files
(2) Update the configuration file
(3) Copy the plugin directory
(4) Execute the upgrade command

The Way to Work
---------------

Setting Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the OpenPNE 3.2.x files to your web server.

Update the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.sample to config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.

If you write your original configuration to your old config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php, you should change the new file.

And copy the old config/database.yml to new config/database.yml.

Copy the Plugin Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the contents in old plugins.

::

  $ cp -aur /path/to/old/OpenPNE3/plugins/* /path/to/new/OpenPNE3/plugins
  $ cp -aur /path/to/old/OpenPNE3/plugins/.* /path/to/new/OpenPNE3/plugins

Execute the Upgrading Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the following command in the project root directory.

::

  $ ./symfony openpne:upgrade-from-30x

Now, upgrading has been done.
