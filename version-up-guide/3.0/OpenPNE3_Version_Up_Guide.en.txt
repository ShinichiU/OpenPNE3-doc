The Way to Work
---------------

Setting Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the OpenPNE 3.0 files to your web server.

You must change the files from the old to avoid troubles by mixing the new with the old.

Update the Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.sample to config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.

If you write your original configuration to your old config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php, you should change the new file.

Execute the Updating Command

Execute the following command in the project root directory.

::

  $ ./symfony openpne:migrate

This command will update OpenPNE and plugins to newer version.

Now, updating has been done.
